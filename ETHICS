Ethical Framework
This project investigates website‑fingerprinting attacks and defenses within the Tor anonymity network. Because this topic touches on user privacy and the potential for misuse, the work is conducted under a strict ethical framework designed to prevent harm, protect anonymity, and ensure that all experimentation remains confined to a controlled research environment.
Purpose of This Project
The goal is to:
- Understand how machine‑learning‑based website fingerprinting attacks operate.
- Evaluate their limitations in realistic, controlled conditions.
- Develop and test defensive countermeasures that improve user privacy.
- Demonstrate technical competency in data collection, feature engineering, and ML modeling.
This project is not intended to deanonymize real users, perform surveillance, or enable adversarial activity.
Scope and Boundaries
Allowed Activities
- Collecting only self‑generated Tor traffic from machines owned and controlled by the project team.
- Using a closed‑world dataset consisting of a small, fixed set of websites selected by the team.
- Performing offline analysis of captured traffic.
- Demonstrating a “real‑time” classifier only on the team’s own Tor client in a private environment.
- Implementing and evaluating defensive techniques such as padding, timing jitter, and traffic morphing.
Prohibited Activities
- Capturing, analyzing, or attempting to classify any third‑party traffic.
- Deploying tools on networks, routers, proxies, or access points that serve other users.
- Attempting to identify, deanonymize, or profile real Tor users.
- Expanding the project into open‑world surveillance or real‑network monitoring.
- Using this codebase for any purpose outside controlled research and education.
Research Ethics Principles
- Respect for Privacy
All experiments use only self‑generated traffic. No personal data from others is collected or processed.
- Transparency
The repository clearly states the project’s purpose, limitations, and ethical constraints.
- Non‑maleficence
The project avoids any action that could harm individuals, compromise anonymity, or weaken trust in privacy tools.
- Reproducibility and Accountability
All scripts, configurations, and assumptions are documented to ensure the work can be understood, audited, and responsibly reproduced.
Intended Audience
This project is designed for:
- Academic or educational demonstrations
- Privacy researchers
- Students learning about traffic analysis
- Developers evaluating defensive strategies
It is not intended for operational use or deployment in adversarial contexts.
Misuse Warning
Any attempt to use this project to monitor, classify, or deanonymize real users is unethical, illegal in many jurisdictions, and strictly against the intent of the authors. The maintainers do not support or condone such misuse.
